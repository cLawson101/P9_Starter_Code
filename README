This repository will only contain the new t0.dir and t0.ok that you will be required to pass as your provided test.

It is to help you to get started while the official repo is still not out.

DO NOT PUSH ANY CHANGES TO THIS REPOSITORY OR ELSE IT WILL NOT BE COUNTED.

How to get started using this repo.

- Make a copy of your p8 repo (this way you don't alter your p8 code)
- Delete t0.dir and t0.ok in the p8 copy repo
- Replace the t0.dir and t0.ok from this repository into your p8 repository.

The README for p9 will be called P9_README

After that you will be able to make the necessary changes to your threads.cc/.h, sys.cc / sys.h and any other files.

AGAIN, AFTER THE OFFICAL REPO HAS BEEN PUBLISHED, MOVE ANY NEW CHANGES FROM YOUR P8 REPO INTO THE NEW P9 REPO.
